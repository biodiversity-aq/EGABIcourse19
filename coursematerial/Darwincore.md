# Darwin Core

The Darwin Core (DwC) is a body of standards maintained by[TDWG](https://www.tdwg.org)  (Biodiversity Information Standards, formerly The International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases).
It includes a glossary of terms intended to facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity by providing reference definitions, examples, and commentaries. The Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, and samples, and related information.

Darwin Core revolves around a standard file format, the Darwin Core Archive (DwC-A). This compact package (a ZIP file) contains interconnected text files and enables data publishers to share their data using a common terminology.
DwC is used both by GBIF and OBIS
 
 
 This standardization not only simplifies the process of publishing biodiversity datasets, it also makes it easy for users to discover, search, evaluate and compare datasets as they seek answers to todayâ€™s data-intensive research and policy questions.
