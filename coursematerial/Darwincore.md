#Darwin Core

The Darwin Core (DwC) is a body of standards maintained maintained by TDWG (Biodiversity Information Standards, formerly The International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases).
It includes a glossary of terms intended to facilitate the sharing of information about biological diversity by providing reference definitions, examples, and commentaries. The Darwin Core is primarily based on taxa, their occurrence in nature as documented by observations, specimens, and samples, and related information.
