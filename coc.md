# Code of Conduct

The organisers of the SCAR-EGABI course are committed to providing a safe, inclusive, welcoming, and harassment-free experience for everyone.

We wish to cultivate a community with shared values, where people are comfortable exploring ideas, asking questions, and saying things like "I don't understand" or "Why". Assume competence in the people you interact with.

Course participants agree to:

- Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

    - offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices; 
    - unwelcome comments regarding a person's lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, or employment
    - sustained or willful disruption of discussions, talks, or other events
    - deliberate intimidation
    - continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
    - unwanted photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes
    - pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others
    - inappropriate physical contact without consent or after a request to stop
    - stalking or following
    - threats of violence or incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
    - use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes
    - unwelcome sexual attention
    - deliberate ‘outing’ of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse
    - deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
    - publication of non-harassing private communication

- Take care of each other. Alert a member of the organising committee if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or a potential violation of this code of conduct, even if it seems inconsequential.


If anyone engages in harassing behavior, the Committee will take action that may include warning the offender or asking them to leave an event or an online channel either temporarily or permanently, or seeking help from law enforcement. If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating this code of conduct, you should report it with a concise description of your grievance.

This Code of Conduct applies to all people participating in the event, including staff and leadership. It applies to all modes of interaction in person and online including GitHub project repositories, Slack, and social media, and includes social gatherings affiliated with the event.

We welcome your feedback on this and every other aspect of the event, and we thank you for working with us to make it a safe, enjoyable, and friendly experience for everyone who participates.
